      <h3>Offseason Training</h3>

      <p>
        Last weekend I decided to take a bit of time to make a video on some of what I do daily. This shows the process of me getting ready for a ride and then biking around my lovely home in Madison, WI. Although the snow has come and it is cold out, that isn't stopping me!

        Throughout winter, I will continue to make videos. This was more of an intro, but I will use my new GoPro more often!

      <h3>Best Workout for Fast Legs</h3>
      <h4>September, 15, 2014 @ 3:27 PM</h4>

        Although I am a biker at my core, I find that running sprints can really help me on longer biking sprints. One of the best running workout that I have done is as follows, good luck!
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <strong>On a track, do the following 2 times for an insane workout and once for a very hard one:</strong>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>800m warmup</li>
          <li>400m sprint</li>
          <li>100m walk</li>
          <li>300m sprint</li>
          <li>50m walk</li>
          <li>250m sprint</li>
          <li>25m walk</li>
          <li>200m sprint</li>
          <li>50m walk</li>
          <li>150m srpint</li>
          <li>25m walk</li>
          <li>100m sprint</li>
          <li>25m walk</li>
          <li>50m sprint</li>
          <li>400m cooldown</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Back when I was in cross country, a coach of mine made me do this. I recently did it when I remembered about it, I will never truly forget that workout - it is brutal. It is one of the best things you can do for you muscles to work them thoroughly as well as making them quick.
