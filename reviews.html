        <h3>Bell Solar Helmet (<span>★</span><span>★</span><span>★</span><span>★</span><span>☆</span>) - $32.99</h3>

          Last week, my 2 year old trusty helmet saved me from a nasty fall. I was sailing down a stright in the road
          when I hit a nasty pothole. Luckily I was wearing layers that day as things have been getting cooler outside.
          I bruised my hands and arms, but no other real damage - that is, execpt for my helmet.
        </p>
        <p>
          My previous helmet had already seen better days, but this fall caused a large crack in the side of it. I rode
          back home and got a new helmet at my local bike shop the next day.
        </p>
        <p>
          After about a week of using this helmet, I can say that I am mostly happy with the purchase. It is there in
          case of an accident like I had last week, however I do wish it allowed for a slightly larger head. Normally
          my head will fit fine in a medium sized helmet, but since I have been wearing a hat lately, it is a tight fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you need an inexpensive and solid helmet, I would say give this one a shot.

        <h3>Trek Émonda SLR 9 (<span>★</span><span>★</span><span>★</span><span>★</span><span>★</span>) - $12,079.99</h3>

        <p>
          After my first ride on the new Émonda SLR 9, I knew that this was my new racing bike. I have loved every aspect
          of it - from the sliky paint job to the premium Shimano drivetrain. This bike is the jackpot of both style as
          well as performance
        </p>
        <p>
          The bike comes in at a very high buy-in, but I promise you that you will love every moment of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I continue to ride on this bike, I will give updates about it's speed, performance and durability - all things
          to consider when purchasing a racing bike.

        <h3>Bike Clown Horn (<span>★</span><span>☆</span><span>☆</span><span>☆</span><span>☆</span>) - $6.99</h3>

          When one of my friends came back from vacation, he said he had a gift for me. Little did I know that I would
          be recieving one of the most pointless and hilarious gifts any biker could ask for. Being the troublmaker that
          my friend always is, he decided to bring home a clown horn for my bike.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a relatively quick install of the horn, I was all set to go - except for my pride. He forced me to keep
          it on while we took a relatively slow ride around the area (he likes to bike for distance, but not race). Upon
          needing to actually use the thing however, I nearly fell off my bike when trying to signal to the person walking
          in front of me.
        </p>
        <p>
          This horn is a great toy, but definitely a toy and not made for a road bike. It caused almost more harm than
          good yesterday and I decided to put on my old bell (which didn't need replacing to begin with!)
